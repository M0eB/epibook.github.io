================

Our book is focused on questions that entail writing programs. You may be asked
questions related to general programming practices, which are conceptual and/or 
knowledge-based, and do not require writing a program. (The extent to which
you are asked such questions depends on the company, your experience, the job, etc.)

Such questions tend to be narrow, and as such are not appropriate for our book.
We have begun the process of collecting representative questions, which you can see below.
